        # Playwright in container needs this to know it doesn't need to install browsers, 
        # basically standard env for CI but good to be explicit if needed. 
        # Actually the container image has browsers pre-installed in specific locations.
        # However, we must ensure HOME is preserved or we point to the right place if needed.
        # But usually just running in container works.
